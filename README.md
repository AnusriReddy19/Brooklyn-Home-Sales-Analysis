Project Overview:
The project aims to analyze and forecast Brooklyn home sales data from 2003 to 2017. The primary dataset is sourced from NYC Housing Sales Data, which was cleaned, merged, and augmented with NYCPluto shapefiles. The goal is to build a time series forecasting model to predict future home sales based on historical data while excluding non-market transactions.

Project Steps:
1.Data Collection and Preprocessing
2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3.Feature Engineering
4.Time Series Modeling

Use time series forecasting models such as ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, or LSTM based on the dataset's characteristics.
Split the data into training and testing sets, considering the chronological order of the sales data.
Train the selected model(s) using the training data.
Evaluate the model(s) using appropriate metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

5.Forecasting and Visualization
6.Incorporating Geospatial Information
7.Conclusion and Future Work
